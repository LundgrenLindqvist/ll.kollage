## Introduction

A small WordPress theme for displaying your photo gallery in a responsive grid. It can be used as a portfolio, a visual journal or as an online moodboard.

## Additional features

The theme can easily be extended to include for instance your Instagram feed using the "WP Instagram Digest" plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-instagram-digest/

## Trouble Shouting / FAQ

### I have installed the theme but I only get the grey loading page?

Please make sure that your images are "attached" to your posts. If the images in your post content are linked directly to external sources or to your WP Media Libary, they will not appear in Kollage. To check if your images are actually attached, simply click "Upload/Insert" and check if you have a "Gallery" tab in the pop-up that appears. If there is no "Gallery" tab the images are not attached and will not show up in Kollage.
